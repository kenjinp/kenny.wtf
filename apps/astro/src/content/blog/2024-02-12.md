# Never-graduating Checkout

Inspired by our end-of-batch reflections and @**Julie Bodian (she) (W1'23)**'s last batch checkin, I wanted to collect some thoughts before moving on to the "alumni channel".

### Here's all the projects I worked on in order

- Procedural Grass Shader
- Typescript implementation of karpathy's micrograd
- Terrain GAN generator
- Astro blog and project showcase
- Twitch continuous live stream
- Tectonics plate simulation planet generation thing

This output seems to be quite small comparatively. I realized I went all-in on graphics stuff for my batch, and any explorations where I went outside of that brief were aggressively integrated into my graphics projects. I've done very little Brownian ping-ponging.

## Random realizations

### There are no gods

The key thing I've learned from RC, is that books are magic, but computers definitely aren't. From hanging out programming in C with @**Jacob Vosmaer (W1'23)** , to learning about AI and Machine learning with @**RÃ©gis Schiavi (he) (W2'24)** and @**Changlin Li (he) (F1'23)** , everything that I thought was inaccessible could be completely demystified even with a 30 minute chat!

I gained confidence that I can get the results that I want from pretty much anything, which feels great if you're a humanities major with imposter syndrome.

## What I want is weird

The best thing about RC are the people. And the thing about everyone I've met here is that they've invested a lot in their crazy points. They create real, wild, art with the craft they've gathered.

I think that's why Impossible Day resonates so much. It inspires me to want to work on **IMPOSSIBLE WIERD** stuff. Like, world-changing, probably unprofitable, hilariously wacky things. I'd love to hear from people what they think that could be. Here's one example: Interspecies communication via ML or something (lets just talk to whales, okay?).

## Post-RC Reflections

### **Did I work at the edge of my abilities?**

This is tough to say, because the goalposts keep moving, which I suppose is kind of the point. In terms of "genre", I think I did not work outside my comfort zone, keeping myself firmly in graphics land, with the exception of ML. In terms of ability, I feel like I progressed a lot in my understanding of shaders, and at the end of this I feel like I can express myself more-or-less. I feel like I could have gone wider, especially by learning new languages.

### **Did I build my volitional muscles?**

I was "fearless in doing what interests me", to the extent where I'm worried I missed out on a lot of cool groups and projects that I would have enjoyed, had I tried them out. I was very single-minded during my batch to work on my procgen projects. I'm skeptical I progressed enough on them to justify that, though.

### **Did I learn generously?**

I think this is where I came up short the most. I didn't do any presentations (although I might after the batch), and I found it difficult to keep up with what the community was up to on. That's mostly because I was wildly disorganized. On the "B"-side of the batch, I increased the amount of pairings I've done, which I identified as being the most time-effective way of learning new things for me. I'm not sure if anyone got any value from me showing off or pairing on my projects, but I hope somehow my stuff could inspire others, in the same way that I feel like the entire topic of procgen is so dang cool and I always love to see that stuff.

> If anyone wants to pair on stuff, let me know, especially leetcode, because I've never done that kind of thing before and I'm nervous to start!

### **What I didn't do**

I wanted to learn more about web assembly and webGPU during my batch. I also wanted to improve the procgen terrain GAN, by improving its output and allowing user input to the model. I also didn't do any presentations, mainly because I'm a chicken ðŸ™ˆ

## Anyways...

I'm so honored and grateful that I was able to do this with all of you. You all inspired me and helped me grow as a programmer. It was also a pleasure to explore New York with ya'll, and I had so many great convos that will stick with me forever.

Of course, I'm not going anywhere (nevergraduate!), so find me in the alumni checkins <3
