# 2026 Roadmap

A brief sketch of where my interests lie at the moment

- Texturing huge worlds
- Creating fantastical world topologies, such as donut worlds, cylinders, hollow earths. 
- webgpu compute shaders to enable all of this to happen

## Creating earth-sized fantastic worlds with Quadtrees
A loveletter to quadtrees as a terrain rendering system. 
I'd like to implement a donut world using this system. 

## Hello-Terrain
An open-world terrain rendering system for threejs/webgpu

## Texturing huge worlds
Where I try to implement a modern open-world texturing system for webgpu. 

## Applying all this to Geomancer
