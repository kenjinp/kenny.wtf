# World Synth

This project is a test bed to create earth-like and earth-sized fantasy worlds, fully rendered, from space-to-ground. It uses the [Hello Worlds](/projects/hello-worlds) javascript library for multithreaded terrain rendering.

I'm trying to generate earth-like worlds using procedural generation techniques outlined here:
