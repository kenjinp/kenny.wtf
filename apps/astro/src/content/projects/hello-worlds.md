description: Virtual javascript worlds at planetary scales for your threejs or react-three-fiber scene 👋🌐

# Hello Worlds

Hello worlds is a typescript library you can use in your threejs or react-three-fiber scene to generate large scale virtual worlds in a variety of topologies.

It uses multi-threading and chunking techniques to calculate terrain meshes in real time.

Create flat terrain for your video game or web experience, or create earth-sized planets. Use Hello-Worlds to make more fantastical worlds, such as ring worlds, inverted hollow-earths, or soon, donut worlds!

I'm looking for users, contributors, and those with any idea to help out!
