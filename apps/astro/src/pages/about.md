# Hello!

I'm a self-taught programmer who has mostly been doing web engineering out of Geneva, CH in the past years, with the [Neuroinformatics](https://bluebrainnexus.io/) team at the [Blue Brain Project](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/) and then later [Nexthink](https://nexthink.com/). Before that I was a fullstack developer in Berlin, and a translator for the film industry in Beijing, China.

I wanted to create procedural tools since hosting my first game of Dungeons and Dragons in 2018. Mostly compelled by the wicked sirensong of worldbuilding, I've been slowly collecting a craft of graphics programming, generative art, and machine learning in order to realize virtual places.

I'm particularly interested in generating locales with a sense of historical or emotional depth, one where a player would be proud to call home, to nurture that feeling when you have the chance to host some friends visiting from out of town for the first time.

I also enjoy sailing, although I'm not good at it. I've trained up to Day Skipper in the RYA rubric.

You can find me reading genre fiction at a laundromat or running along the East River.

Give me your book recommendations and tell me the world is gonna be okay ❤️.

## Looking to hire me? [Here's my Resumé!](/kenneth-pirman-resume.pdf)

I just finished my batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), and now after all that self-direction exploration of programming, I'm ready to join a new crew.

If you're building a team that makes use of high-performance web technologies and graphics programming, I'll be interested in hearing from you!
