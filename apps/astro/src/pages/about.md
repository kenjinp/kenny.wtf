# Hello!

I'm a member of the Technical Staff at [Character.ai](https://character.ai/), where I build chat interfaces. I'm currently based in Brooklyn, NYC.

I'm a self-taught programmer who has mostly been doing web engineering out of Geneva, CH with the [Neuroinformatics](https://bluebrainnexus.io/) team at the [Blue Brain Project](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/) and then later [Nexthink](https://nexthink.com/). Before that I was a fullstack developer for the mobile games industry in Berlin, and a translator for the film industry in Beijing, China.

I wanted to create procedural generation tools since running my first ttrpg in 2018. Mostly compelled by the wicked sirensong of worldbuilding, I've been slowly collecting a craft of graphics programming, generative art, and machine learning in order to realize fictional places, virtually.

I'm particularly interested in generating locales with a sense of historical or emotional depth. A place where a player would be proud to call home. I'd like to foster that feeling when you host a friend visiting your town for the first time, where you see through their eyes and become a tourist again, but combined with the connection and experience you carry with the place, having lived there. That kind of pyscho-geographic fondness. Is it possible to evoke this feeling, for a virtual space?

I'm a serial long-traveler. The last decade or more I was living in China and Europe. Most recently I was living in Wales after finishing my batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

I also enjoy sailing, although I'm not good at it. I've trained up to Day Skipper in the RYA rubric.

You can find me reading genre-fiction at a laundromat or running along the East River.
